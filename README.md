    *   Apply various classifiers: `Logistic Regression`, `SVM`, `Random Forest`.
    *   `Cross-Validation` and `Hyperparameter Tuning` to build a reliable model.

**48. Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention**
*   **Link:** [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henrysue/online-shoppers-purchasing-intention-dataset)
*   **Main Objective:** To predict whether an online visitor will end their session with a purchase.
*   **Applicable Syllabus Concepts:**
    *   Binary classification.
    *   `Feature Engineering` from page values and visit types.
    *   `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Trees`, `Ensemble Methods`.
    *   `ROC AUC` and `F1-Score` are good metrics.

**49. Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions**
*   **Link:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection - Anomaly Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fractalquer/credit-card-fraud-detection-anomaly-detection)
*   **Main Objective:** Similar to #12 but often used to frame the problem as anomaly detection.
*   **Applicable Syllabus Concepts:**
    *   While anomaly detection has its own algorithms, it can be approached with classifiers.
    *   The `Curse of Dimensionality` and the importance of `PCA` are relevant.
    *   `SVM` (specifically One-Class SVM, though not in the syllabus) is a related concept. You can use a standard `SVM` and see how it performs on this highly imbalanced data.

**50. Connect 4**
*   **Link:** [Connect 4 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/connect-4-data-set)
*   **Main Objective:** To predict the winner of a Connect 4 game given a board state.
*   **Applicable Syllabus Concepts:**
    *   Multi-class classification (win, loss, draw).
    *   `Decision Trees` and `Random Forests` work well on this type of rule-based data.
    *   `Naive Bayes` can be applied by treating each board position as a feature.
    *   A good dataset for exploring the `Bias-Variance Tradeoff`. A simple model may have high bias, while a complex Random Forest might overfit.
